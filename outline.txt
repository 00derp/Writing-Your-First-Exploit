Outline of lecture:

(1) Understanding buffer overflow exploits
	-- See simpleoverflow.c

(2) Socket programming in Python
	-- See banner-grabber.py and port-scanner.py

(3) Fuzzing
	-- See fuzzer.py

(4) Fine tuning the fuzzer
	-- Finding the exact position at which the instruction pointer is overwritten.
	-- Give "trun ." the following buffer:
		badbuf = "A" * 2006 + "B" * 4 + "C" * 24
	
(5) Gaining control of the stack pointer
	-- Using Immunity Debugger to locate a jmp esp instruction in vulnerver.exe or essfunc.dll

(6) Generating a payload with msfvenom
	-- See exploit.py

(7) Completing the exploit
	-- See exploit.py

(8) Writing shellcode by hand
	-- See custom-payload-calc.py and custom-payload-add-user.py
